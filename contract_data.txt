When a customer submits a job request on Thumbtack, this information is sent to Pros in the area who might be interested in it. If it looks like there's a fit, a Pro can respond with a custom quote that includes a personal message and a price estimate.

Thumbtack tries to help Pros pick a price estimate range using historical contractData, which contains prices for the same job type in the same area. You have been asked to implement the following two-step price suggestion algorithm:

1. In the first step, contractData, which is guaranteed to have an even length, is sorted and divided into two groups:
 * the first group contains the first half of the elements in contractData.
 * the second group contains the other half;
2. In the second step, the median values of the first and the second groups are found:
 *the median of the first group is rounded down and returned as the lower price bound;
 *the median of the second group is rounded up and returned as the upper price bound.
If the data is insufficient (i.e. contractData contains fewer than 2 elements), a suggestion cannot be made, so nothing should be returned.
A median of a sorted N-element sequence is defined as follows: If N is odd, the median is the element which stands in the middle. If N is even, then the median is the mean of the two middle elements.

Using the given contractData, find the lower and the upper bounds of the suggested price estimate range.

Example

priceSuggestion([10, 15, 14, 7, 11, 15]) = [10, 15].
The first step produces groups [7, 10, 11] and [14, 15, 15];
The second step returns 10 and 15.
priceSuggestion([]) = []
[input] array.integer contractData

A list of prices for the same job type in the same area that's guaranteed to have an even length.
[output] array.integer

Array of two elements denoting the suggested price range, or an empty array if the given data is insufficient.
