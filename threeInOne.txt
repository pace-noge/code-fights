You are given and array arr. Calculate its average rounded down to the nearest integer, and apply operator to the obtained result and the second value.

Example:

ThreeInOne([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 9], "/", 2) = 2

arr's average equals (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 8 + 9) / 8 = 4, so the answer is 4 / 2 = 2.
