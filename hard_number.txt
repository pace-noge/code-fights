You are given a number n. Count down from n to 1 in accordance with the following condition:
Each triplet but the first one should be reversed. If there're not enough numbers to make triplets, return "-1" instead.

Examples:

HardNumber(9) = "987456123"
the first 3 numbers are 9, 8 and 7, so the countdown begins as "987";
the next 3 numbers are 6, 5, and 4. This tripled should be reversed, so the countdown continues to "987456";
the last triplet is 3, 2 and 1. This one should also be reversed, so the final answer is "987456123".
HardNumber(10) = -1
the first 3 numbers are 10, 9 and 8;
the next triplet is 7, 6, 5;
the next one is 4, 3, 2;
finally, there's only 1 left, which doesn't belong to any triplet.
