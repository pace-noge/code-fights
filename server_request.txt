requests with numbers from 1 to 2 * i inclusive. However, each server can process only one request at a time.

Given the number of servers n and the requests that should be processed, return the maximum number of requests that can be processed simultaneously, assuming that processing each request takes the same amount of time.

Example:

processingRequests(2, [1,5,6]) = 1
Each server can process request 1, but neither can process requests 5 or 6, so only request with number 1 can be processed.
processingRequests(3, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]) = 3
The first server can process requests from 1 to 2, the second one can process requests from 1 to 4, and the last one can process requests from 1 to 6, so they can easily start with processing 3 requests at a time.
[input] integer servers

The number of servers, 0 ≤ servers ≤ 1000.
[input] array.integer requests

A sorted array of distinct positive integers, where each integer represents a request, 1 ≤ requests.length ≤ 1005.
[output] integer

The maximum number of requests that can be processed simultaneously.
