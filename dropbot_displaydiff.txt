When a file in a user's Dropbox folder is changed, while synchronizing Dropbox tries to only upload the parts of the file that are different. The first step to accomplish this involves building a representation of the difference between the two versions of the same file.

As part of Dropbox's engineering team, you've decided to implement a function that will represent the difference between two strings in the following format:

Two strings are merged into one.
Text that is present in both versions is left untouched.
Text that is present only in the old version is enclosed in parentheses ((, )).
Text that is present only in the new version is enclosed in brackets ([, ]).
Among all possible representations, your function returns the shortest one (brackets and parentheses do not count).
Among representations of minimal length, your function returns the lexicographically smallest one (lexicographic order means that the strings are arranged in a similar fashion as they are presumed to appear in a dictionary).
For this task, please, assume that any other character < '(' < ')' < '[' < ']'.
Now all you have to do is to implement this function.

Example

For oldVersion = "same_prefix_1233_same_suffix"

and newVersion = "same_prefix23123_same_suffix"

the answer is displayDiff(oldVersion, newVersion) = "same_prefix(_1)23[12]3_same_suffix".

[input] string oldVersion

[input] string newVersion

It is guaranteed that neither oldVersion nor newVersion contains parentheses or brackets.
[output] string

A string built from oldVersion and newVersion satisfying all of the conditions mentioned above.
